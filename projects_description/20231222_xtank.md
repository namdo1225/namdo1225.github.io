## Description

For a class project in my Objected-Oriented Programming class, my partner and I created a local multiplayer game where players battle with tanks. You can select from 4 tank types of varying speed and shield along with 4 different maps. We have used SWT (The Standard Widget Toolkit) to provide graphics for this program. This program is the first time I am introduced to the concept of threads and utilized network sockets to create connections from one computer to another.

## My Contribution

I designed the user interface to make it so that players can select between hosting and joining a game without having to relaunch the application to switch between these two actions. I also created the map classes, the controllers, and threads to ensure that the game can be played in real time. I also helped my partner with programming the game logic as needed.

## Instruction to use:

1) Click "Host Game" to host a new game. Click "Join Game" to join an existing game.

2) As a host, pick the game's map, choose the tank's lives, and update the port number if needed. Click "Host" to host the game.

3) As a player, select your tank, set the IP address, and port number if needed. Click "Next" to join the game.
