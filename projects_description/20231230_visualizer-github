## Description

For a 4-member group project, we created a Windows program that can abstract many Git commands and provide a visual interface for these functionalities. The program also has the ability to work with the GitHub API and perform various functionalities with your remote repositories.

## My Contribution

I originally wrote the various methods to interact with the GitHub API and created the unit tests. However, after forking on it, I solely continued to develop the app, including working with Window Forms to polish the UI and working with other APIs to work with local repositories.

## Instruction to use:
