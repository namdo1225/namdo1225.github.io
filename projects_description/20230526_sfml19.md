title: SFML19 Roguelike Dungeon
description: This is a personal project in which I use a custom graphics library called SFML (<a href="https://www.sfml-dev.org/">Source</a>) to make a simple roguelike dungeon game. You could say it is pretty much completed with some enemies, items, and level generation programmed out. It just needs some debugging with the UI, but it is completed otherwise. Maybe I will come back to it in the future.

## Description

I used SFML, a graphics library, in order to create a simple roguelike dungeon game. This genre is typically a game where the player character has to traverse a (usually endless) dungeon. They can fight enemies, collect items, purchase products in shops, and use spells.

I also created the sound effects and sprites.

Features:
<ul>
  <li>Randomly generated (and potentially endless, as far as the int upper bound allows).</li>
  <li>Randomly placed enemies that can seek and kill you if you get too close.</li>
  <li>Randomly placed items and gold.</li>
  <li>Use shops to buy/sell items and spells.</li>
  <li>You can customize your character with different equipments and spells.</li>
  <li>You can fight monsters and level up your characters to get stronger.</li>
  <li>There's a stat system to roleplay and balance your character.</li>
  <li>A save system to record your progress in the game.</li>
</ul>

## Process

To implement these different features, I needed to apply the object-oriented programming paradigm. There are spells, items, the interface, enemies, and so forth. Many of these more general types of object typically receive a parent class. Specific enemies like Zombies are the sub-classes to one of these parent classes.

I use other techniques like method overriding and overloading in order to make my classes very flexible and extensible.

## Disclaimer

I started this project back in 2020. I recently updated the documentation and tried to clean up the code a bit. I wanted to post it here to show how much I have grown as a programmer. Therefore, this project does not reflect my current programming capability (plus, C++ is somewhat old, I prefer C# which make things cleaner and shorter).
