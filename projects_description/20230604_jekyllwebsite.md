## Project Specification
<ul>
  <li>Tools/Languages: HTML, CSS, GitHub, Jekyll (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Source</a>)</li>
  <li>Environment: Personal Project</li>
  <li>Timeline: 1 week. Started in 2023.</li>
</ul>

## Description

I used Jekyll, a static site generator that aids in the creation of static sites. This tool is often useful for sites that are more about presenting and storing static data, like your resume or project portfolio. Using GitHub's ability to host webpages, I was able to host this website under my GitHub username.

## Domain

Through [name.com](https://www.name.com/), I was able to point the address namdo.live points to this site. Currently, it is under a trial/student license run, so I cannot keep it for long. However, I just want to point out when the license expires that this used to have a address at one point.
