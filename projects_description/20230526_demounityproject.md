## Description

For the final class project in my introduction to game design, my team and I are tasked with creating a 5-minute playable demo of a game. We decided on making a platform horror game. I was primarily responsible for designing the UI with proper control flows, but I also dabbled in many aspects of the project overall, including scripting in C#, debugging, organizing project folders and hierarchy, and modifying game logic in Unity.

## Video

You can watch this video (as narrated by me) for more information:

## My Work

As you can see from the video, I set up the main menu, buttons, and UI. With the help of Youtube videos, I was able to program the player's movement and camera rotation.

Besides UI, I mainly augment aspects of the project that my team members did, as well as combine everything together:
<ol>
  <li>One member programmed the obstacles, but for some reason, the speed and movement range of the obstacle were linked. I was able to separate both features into separate variables so the barrier's speed and distance could be adjusted independently.</li>
  <li>I updated another's member movement script so that the player's movement, dash, etc. would flow along with the third-person camera.</li>
</ol>
