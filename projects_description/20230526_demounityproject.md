## Description

For the final class project in my introduction to game design, my team and I are tasked with creating a 5 minutes playable demo of a game. We decided on making a platforming horror game. I was primarily responsible for designing the UI with proper control flows, but I also dabbled in many aspects of the project overall including scripting in C#, debugging, organizing project folders and hierarchy, and modifying game logic in Unity.
