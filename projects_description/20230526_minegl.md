## Description

GLFW is an OpenGL library which allows me to use shaders to draw shapes to the screen output. With the help of random noise generation and Minecraft texture packs (since it's personal and non-commerical, I believe it's fine if I just take it), I was able to create a simple Minecraft world and fly around it.

A picture of the randomly generated world: You can see the height elevation, creating a mountainous world.

Some features:
<ul>
  <li>There's a tool near the top of the windows that allow you to do some cool debugging feature</li>
  <li>I am working on a meshing algorithm to cull invisible shapes that players cannot see. It allows the program to run faster.</li>
</ul>

You can see the red lines indicating the edge of a chunk. Blocks are generated in 16 (X) * 16 (Z) * 256 (Y) chunks.

Blocks that are not usually visible to the player (such as being underground) won't be loaded.
You can see the culling in this picture.

## Disclaimer

I am not going to upload the texture files in the repository for obvious reasons. This repository is meant for educational purposes only.
