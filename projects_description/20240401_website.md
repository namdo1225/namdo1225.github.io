## Description

The Thaddeus Resource Center website was originally built using a website builder named Webflow. It allowed you to build a website essentially without touching any code. While that was great, we eventually switched to developing it in TypeScript and React, allowing us to cut costs, add new features, and learn more about the programming world. We also got the opportunity to standardize many processes when transitioning, such as providing proper training and documentation for the website.

Note: Just in case you are reading this after I leave the internship, please forgive me for not updating the tenses.

## My Contribution

### Popup System

My most important contribution is designing, implementing, and testing the popup system. The pop-up system allows logged-in employees to create and edit pop-ups. These pop-ups can inform website visitors of organization updates, advertisements, event notifications, or just general messages.

I have set up permission such that while any intern can create and edit pop-ups, only administrative staff, such as our Executive Director, can delete or make a pop-up active (to be available for showing).

The employees can customize many aspects of this pop-up, including adding a header and body message. They can add a button or make the entire pop-up take them to another website when clicked on. They can also pick between many templates (allowing pictures to be centered, left-justified, right-justified, or take up everything). Last but not least, the user can adjust the colors of a lot of these aspects, including the pop-up's background and text's color.

I am testing this system using end-to-end tests via Cypress, making sure I run through the cycle from creating a pop-up all the way to displaying it and deleting it.

One particular feature my supervisor requested is making it possible to show unique pop-ups on different pages of the website. To do that, I add a "page" field to the schema of the pop-up. It is essentially a string that specifies where the pop-up should be displayed.

### Frontend Work

Of course, I also helped out with the frontend of the website. I was primarily helping out with the "How We Help" section of the page. The section originally lacked a lot of content. Fortunately, I approached it from the beginning.

First, I reached out to people who have information about developing those pages to get information about those pages. I asked them if they had any text to fill up the page and media that would make it more visually appealing. From there, I use common standards to develop the website if they do not have any suggestions on how I should create it. For example, this means using icons to signify many features of the organization's program. Finally, I show the stakeholders the website for feedback. After finally getting their approval, I push my changes to GitHub and merge the branch into production.
