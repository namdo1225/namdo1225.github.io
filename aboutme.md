Hi, my name is Nam Do. I am an upcoming B.S. Computer Science graduate at the University of Arizona, and am currently searching for an internship related to software engineering. I am currently an information technology student worker at the University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law and have been in this position for more than 4 years. I am excited to say that I am also a Software Development Intern at the Thaddeus Resource Center, doing app development using React Native and web design using Webflow.

## My Skill

As an upcoming CS graduate, I am experienced with many programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. This includes web development languages such as HTML and CSS as well. I have been involved in many projects, including using Unity to create a playable demo of a game and creating a music player that could look up demo music on Spotify using the Spotify API.

In addition, I also have familiarity with many types of programming paradigms and approaches, such as the Design Patterns of Object-Oriented Programming and Agile development.

## My Experience

For my software development job at the Thaddeus Resource Center, I am developing the organization's primary app in JavaScript and React Native. I have created reusable components for the app's resource section that improve the reusability of the application overall while minimizing the amount of code. Currently, I am developing the journal section of the app, in which users can type in journal entries and record their daily mood. I am also assigned to continually improve Thaddeus' main website using Webflow, which is a website designer that allows you to easily create beautiful websites.

Through my IT job, I have maintained an inventory of more than 300 university devices (desktops, laptops, etc.). I am primarily tasked with setting up these devices (installing OSes and so forth) so that they meet the university's and college's standards. Last but not least, like many others in IT, I have resolved many tickets from users on ServiceNow, by email, or through walk-in support.

I have also worked as a student worker for the JD-Next program (https://jd-next.org/), a "fully-online course (that) introduces students to the kinds of doctrinal concepts and legal skills that students will encounter at law school". I mainly provide technical support for the student and the organizational team as needed, but I have also dabbled in Visual Basic for Applications in Excel and mail merge to create various PDF reports and CSV files.

As a last note, back in high school, my school had a work study program that I participated in. I got the opportunity to work at Sun Tran and O'Rielly Chevrolet, mainly learning more about professional ethics and the office setting. This work study program is where I first started working for my IT job before being hired as their student worker.
