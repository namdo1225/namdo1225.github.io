Hi, my name is Nam Do. I am a upcoming B.S. Computer Science graduate at the University of Arizona, currently searching an internship related to software engineering. I am currently an Information Technology student worker at The University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law and have been at this position for more than 4 years. I have also worked as a JD-Next student worker, primarily being the first contact for technical support as well as using Visual Basic for Applications to create and format Excel files.

## My Skill

As an upcoming CS graduate, I am experienced with many programming languages including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. This includes web development languages such as HTML and CSS as well. I have been involved in many projects, including using Unity to create a playable demo of a game to creating a music player that could look up demo music on Spotify using the Spotify API.

In addition, I also have familarity with many types of programming paradigms and approaches such as the Design Patterns of Object-Oriented Programming and Agile Development.

## My Experience

I have been working as an IT student worker at The University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law for more than four years. Through that, I have maintained an inventory of more than 300 University devices (desktop, laptops, etc.). I am primarily tasked with setting up these devices (installing OSes and so forth) so that they meet University's and College's standard. Last but not least, like many others in IT, I have resolved many tickets from users on ServiceNow, by emails, or through walk-in support.

I have also worked as a student worker for the JD-Next program (https://jd-next.org/), a "fully-online course introduces students to the kinds of doctrinal concepts and legal skills that students will encounter at law school". I mainly provide technical support for the student and the organizational team as needed, but I have also dabbled in Visual Basic for Applications in Excel and mail merge to create various PDF reports and .csv files.

As a last note, back in high school, my school had a work study program that I participated in. I got the opportunity to work at Sun Tran and O'Rielly Chevrolet mainly learning more about professional ethics and the office setting. This work study program is where I first started working for my IT job before being hired as their student worker.

## Contact Me

Please feel free to reach out to me through my email first. It is sometime hard to tell whether a call is a spam or not, so please reach out to me via email first. I also have a LinkedIn profile as well, so you can always contact me through there.
