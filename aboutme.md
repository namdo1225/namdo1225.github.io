## Overview

Hi, I am Nam Do. I am a software engineer working at [Ephibian, Inc.](https://www.ephibian.com/) I have a bachelor's in computer science from the University of Arizona. Previously I was a Web Development Intern at the Thaddeus Resource Center, pioneering the transition of the organization’s website from Webflow to Next.js. I also worked as an information technology student worker at the James E. Rogers College of Law for five years.

As a software engineer, I am experienced with many programming languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python. This includes web development languages such as HTML and CSS as well. I have been involved in many projects, including using Unity to create a playable demo of a game and creating a music player that could look up demo music on Spotify using the Spotify API.

In addition, I also have familiarity with many types of programming paradigms and approaches, such as the Design Patterns of Object-Oriented Programming and Agile development.

## My Experience

As a software engineer at Ephibian, I develop full-stack software solutions for clients that often have over thousands of customers. Work can range from overhauling a website to a new framework to creating new API endpoints to retrieve data for the frontend.

### Thaddeus Resource Center

For my web development job at the Thaddeus Resource Center, I helped pioneer the transition of the organization’s website from Webflow to Next.js. Back before I started, the website was developed and hosted on Webflow, a no-code website builder. With the help of the rest of the web squad, we created a repository on GitHub to develop this new website in code. I developed reusable React components in JavaScript that are widely utilized throughout the frontend. Most importantly, I implemented a CRUD interface so that any company employee can create and modify website pop-ups.

I also was previously tasked with app development. I was developing the organization's primary app in JavaScript and React Native. I created reusable components for the app's resource section that improve the reusability of the application overall while minimizing the amount of code.

In both positions, I wrote documentation and standardized processes to ensure new interns understand the job's requirements and technology, properly onboarding them and ensuring they have reference materials to rely on.

### Information Technology Positions

Through my IT job, I maintained an inventory of more than 300 university devices (desktops, laptops, etc.). I was primarily tasked with setting up these devices (installing OSes and so forth) so that they meet the university's and college's standards. Last but not least, like many others in IT, I resolved many tickets from users on ServiceNow, by email, or through walk-in support.

I also worked as a student worker for the [JD-Next program](https://jd-next.org/), a "fully-online course (that) introduces students to the kinds of doctrinal concepts and legal skills that students will encounter at law school." I mainly provided technical support for the student and the organizational team as needed, but I also dabbled in Visual Basic for Applications in Excel and mail merge to create various PDF reports and CSV files.

As a last note, back in high school, my school had a work-study program that I participated in. I got the opportunity to work at Sun Tran and O'Rielly Chevrolet, mainly learning more about professional ethics and the office setting. This work-study program is where I first started working for my IT job before being hired as their student worker.
