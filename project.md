					<h3>[COMPLETED] Class Project: Small Unity Game Demo</h3>
				</header>
				<p>For a four-person group project in GAME 351: Game Programming, my group created a 5-minutes platforming and horror game in Unity. I was mainly responsible for designing the UI, but at the end, I dabbled in many aspects of the project including helping with scripting in C#.</p>

					<h3>[COMPLETED] Class Project: Spotify Demo Music Player</h3>
				</header>
				<p>For my project in CSc 335: Object-Oriented Programming (Java), we used the MVC model as well as many Object-Oriented design patterns to create a music player that can search for songs on Spotify (or at least songs that Spotify allow us to play) using the Spotify API. I was primarily responsible for keeping track of tasks using Trello and coding classes so that the music player could communicate with the Spotify API.</p>

					<h3>[DEBUG] SFML19 Rouge-like Dungeon</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This is a personal project in which I use a custom graphics library called SFML (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) to make a simple rouge-like dungeon game. You could say it is pretty much completed with some enemies, items, and level generation programmed out. It just needs some debugging with the UI, but it is completed otherwise. Maybe I will come back to it in the future.</p>
